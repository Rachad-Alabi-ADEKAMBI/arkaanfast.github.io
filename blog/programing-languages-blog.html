          Programming Languages !

        <h1 class="top-size-font-blog">
          I get a lot of queries and questions on which are the best programming
          languages to learn ? Which programming language should I start with ?
          So I decided why not write a blog on this topic.

          For people who are just entering into the field of coding/development,
          which, by the way are not the same (will be posting a blog on that
          too) feel that learning programming languages is all a computer
          science student or a software engineer or a developer does. Let me
          tell you one thing: programming language is the least of our concern
          when it comes to developing softwares ! Apart from this they also feel
          that the more programming languages they learn, the better. Again this
          also does not actually matter at all. “It’s not the quantity but it's
          the quality that's important “ what do I mean by this, well….keep
          reading.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">
          If you ever get confused on which programming language you should
          start learning, let me give you some insights on this (as an
          experienced developer myself with around 3 years of experience). For
          starters it really does not matter which programming language you
          choose as your first language, it may be C++, C, Python, Java etc etc.
          You might be wondering why am I saying this, right ? All the
          programming languages are
          <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">SIMILAR</span>
          to one another, yup they are similar. How are they similar ? There are
          topics which are common to all of the programming languages, topics
          that work in the same way under the hood for all the languages.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">These topics are:-</p>

        >
          <li>Variables</li>
          <li>Conditions ( if, else if, switch(not in some languages))</li>
          <li>Functions</li>
          <li>Loops ( for loops, while loops)</li>
          <li>Classes and objects (not in c)</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="blog-para">
          The topics I listed above are common in all the languages and they
          work the same way in all of them. So if you pick any language and get
          these basics, fundamentals of programming right then that's enough.
          The differences between programming languages vary depending on speed,
          library support and yes, the SYNTAX(the way you write the code). For
          example the ‘for loop’ in Python and C++ works in the same way but the
          way you write it is different for each of them. C++ is faster compared
          to Python. So for applications that need to be faster, use C++ to
          build them, like games, servers etc.

          In this field of computers and technologies, learning never stops. We
          need to keep updating ourselves with the current technologies, shift
          to using different programming languages that support a particular
          tech stack to satisfy certain constraints. So we need to keep
          ourselves updated.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">
          Learning programming languages won't be a hustle at all, if your
          basics in programming is strong. To build a strong foundation the
          first language you learn whichever may it be, learn each concept
          thoroughly and get the basics right, understand how things work under
          the hood, understand how variables work, how a for loop works. Once
          you have completely understood the basics it will be pretty easy for
          you to learn some other language.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-para">
          Again, practice makes a person perfect, you have to keep practicing,
          coding, solving coding problems to get better at it, platforms like
          hackerrank, code chef etc has a variety of coding questions from the
          easiest ones to the hardest ones. I suggest after you have learnt your
          first language, take up a simple project and complete it. This way you
          learn more through bugs and typing. I would like to end by saying that
          it does not matter how many programming languages you know, what
          matters is whether you know how to use them to build or solve
          problems.
