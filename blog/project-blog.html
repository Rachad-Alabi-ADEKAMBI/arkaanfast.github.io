                    As mentioned in the previous blogs, it is important that you
                    start building projects while you are learning, this way you
                    learn more and grow faster. In this blog I will be
                    addressing a common problem you might face while working on
                    your first project. Also as a bonus I will give you the link
                    to my first ever project I had developed after I learnt
                    python. It's nothing fancy, just a simple project.

                        I know it's been so long since my last blog here. Before
                        going ahead make sure you have read the previous blogs.
                        So let's get started, shall we ?

                        Hold on, I need to address one more very important thing
                        now. Guys, there will be times you get frustrated, you
                        get stuck and feel like there is no way to solve it.
                        This happens even to most of the experienced developers,
                        and it is completely normal. The important thing is that
                        you must <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">NOT
                            GIVE UP</span>. Whenever you come across any
                        problems or bugs, remember there is always a way to
                        solve it. If you don't know how to, you will eventually
                        find out, just take a few deep breaths, get your mind
                        off the task, relax and try again. Trust me, 90% of the
                        time this works. Even if you can’t find the solution, we
                        have the internet to our rescue !! So just google your
                        problems out and you will come across a solution, but do
                        remember when you do this it is very important to
                        understand the solution, go through each line of the
                        code and understand how it is working. This is VERY
                        IMPORTANT as it will help you improve and you could tell
                        yourself that “Now I am a better developer than who I
                        was yesterday “. <span style="color: rgb(255, 255,

                        think are
                        better at coding than you, so that you can learn and
                        grow. If you don't have a developer buddy<span

                        Whenever you are working on something, make it simple,
                        and this is something I got from a lot of self
                        development books that I’ve read.<span
                            style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"> Make it simple
                            first
                            then make it efficient and add all the features you
                            need</span>. Earlier when I had started developing
                        projects, I
                        always used to think of the complexities, the advanced
                        stuff and I kept on reading articles, watching videos
                        etc. Do not do this. Doing this would waste your time
                        and also you might not start the project, this has
                        happened to me multiple times. That's when a senior of
                        mine told me not to think too much and just start with
                        your project and<span
                            style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"> MAKE IT SIMPLE</span>
                        then go for efficiency. This is a better and a faster
                        approach, which helped me grow as a developer. You might
                        be wondering, how is it fast? Won't it be faster if we
                        think of an efficient solution first? Yes! It would be
                        faster if you can think of an efficient solution first,
                        but most of the time that usually does not happen if you
                        are a beginner, although with practice you will get
                        better and faster at it. So make it simple, <span
                            style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">JUST START
                            and be in the process.</span>

                            Let me share my experience while I was building this
                            snake and ladders game. The game I had developed was
                            nothing fancy, no GUI, just a terminal input-output
                            kinda thing (run the code and you will find out!).
                            It
                            was just giving input and checking the output kinda
                            game,where you can choose the number of players
                            playing, give player names and the game starts.
                            Hitting enter, you see the number on the terminal
                            and then you move up the board if you encounter a
                            snake or a ladder, it pops up a message on the
                            terminal. The first time I developed this project,
                            it was not good at all, well I thought it was
                            awesome but when I had asked my senior Ihthisham to
                            review it he told me <span
                                style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">“BRO THIS IS
                                NOT GOOD”</span>, and
                            then I asked him, why? It's working fine. He said
                            yes good work with that but try to make it efficient
                            now, its over 300 lines of code you can improve it.
                            So I invested some more time on this project, learnt
                            a few new concepts (classes and objects and how to
                            use it effectively) and <span
                                style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">reduced the
