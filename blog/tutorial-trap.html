          Tutorial Trap!

          The reason I am writing a blog on this is because I had fallen into
          this trap once, and like me, many of my friends did too. So I decided
          to give you guys a heads up on this, about what it is (you must have
          understood from the title), and how not to fall for it.

          When I began my journey as a developer, I was quite intrigued with the
          vastness of Computer Science and the innumerable opportunities that it
          had. I was quite confused, ‘What do I learn ??’,

            >Web Development, App Development, AI, Cloud Computing etc, and in
            addition to these, so many programming languages.</span

          from it..

          First and foremost the most important thing is passion, do something
          that excites you, that fascinates you, so that doing it won't lead to
          boredom and you will be consistent with your work. If programming is
          not something that you are passionate about, keep exploring until you
          find what drives you, keep experimenting, keep failing, it does not
          matter because at the end of the day we ought to be proud and happy
          with ourselves,
          <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">that's what matters !!.</span>

          As the name suggests, Tutorial trap is getting trapped in this never
          ending loop of jumping from one tutorial to the other. You might
          wonder,
          <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"
            >Why is it a trap ? Isn't it a good thing that we are doing courses
            and learning new things every time ? </span
          >Well, from my experience I must say that it’s really frustrating and
          exhausting and definitely not at all a good idea. This way you will
          not see any progress in developing your career, at least I didn’t
          while I was trapped here and neither did my friends (developer
          buddies).

          You think about it .…. you keep learning, learning and learning, but
          never really implement whatever you've learnt. You're not typing any
          code, not coming across bugs, not testing, and not failing, then how
          will you learn? It's a proven fact that only when you implement the
          things you learn, you improve and understand it better. I have
          experienced it as well and I am sure some of the pros reading this
          have experienced the same. If you have the knowledge, but have no
          skill implementing it then you have wasted your time acquiring it. If
          you are in this trap where you are constantly learning new programming
          languages one after the other, or learning new tech stacks one after
          the other, please stop doing it.

          I have been reading this amazing book
          <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"
            >‘The 7 Habits of highly effective people’ by Stephen R. Covey (I
            suggest you all give it a read).</span

          In this the author talks about something known as P/PC balance. I will
          just give a brief of what it is and if you want more insight on it, do
          check the book out. So here, in P/PC, the P stands for Production and
          PC stands for Production Capability. Production is the outcome of
          Production Capability. Production Capability is what you learn through
          courses/tutorials and Production is how you develop something out of
          what you have learnt. The balance here is very important and if not
          maintained, could lead to negativity or you might even consider
          quitting.

          >....it’s pretty simple. In terms of learning a new language, let’s
          say you have learnt Python as your first language, don't jump into
          something else after you have got your basics right (please read my
          previous blog). Use your Python knowledge and build some simple
          projects using it. Try solving coding problems using Python.This way
          you will be typing, coming across a lot of bugs (and bugs are really
          good to come across too, you learn and get to know so many different
          things)
